                    <p><b>Games</b> have always been one of my key interests, whether it's playing video games, watching streams of people playing video games, 
                        or simply reading about video games.</p>
                    <p>I hope to one day make my own game, and have taken the first steps towards learning how to make some in Godot with 
                        <a href="https://www.gamedev.tv/courses/godot-c-action-adventure">this course.</a></p>
                    <p>You can see more about my pastime interests in the interests tab, located in the dropdown menu.</p>
                    <p>At first I studied to become an engineer without really thinking about what I wanted to do with my life, just kinda going with the flow,
                        but as I struggled to find work, I eventually decided I had to reevaluate what I wanted to do, and decided I wanted to learn programming. <br>
                        Previously I've dabbled in programming-adjacent tasks with logic gates in Garry's Mod, as well as other games focusing on automation. <br>
                        Now I'm here, studying programming, while apprenticing at Arotek.
